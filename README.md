# GamEncin

## Description
This is a simple game engine that I am developing for fun.
It is written in C++ and uses OpenGL for rendering.
The engine is still in development and is not ready for use.
This message is written by AI 🤠🤠.

## Features
-Ok I'm writing this now.
-For now, engine has some kind of object system and some basic logic in these objects.
-I inspired by Unity in object system like MonoBehaviour.
-Every object is in a scene and has some functions that are called in their times.
-Also every object has some main features like position, rotation, scale etc.
-For now, I only have .h and .cpp files that I need, I'm unsure about how the future will be.
-Probably there won't be any final version of this project.
-I try to write the cleanest code I can all the time.
-Nothing is done in one day in this world, so just trying something.

## How to use
-Project is probably not compatible with any other system than mine.
-I didn't use cmake for this because when I tried to use it, it went
so bad just as like ECS for handling objects.
-In the main loop, first create the Application singleton.
-Then create a scene and build your scene.
-Then run the application 🥳🥳🥳🥳.

## Dependencies
-GLFW
-GLAD
-GLM
-I might be changed these libraries a little.
