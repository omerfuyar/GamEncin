# GamEncin

## IMPORTANT
This project is one of my old project. It's developed in a few months. I learned so much from this project I really respect it even though I find it disgusting when I look back to it. So that means this project is discontinued until further notice. Notice to huge void who is reading this. The last thing I did is configure build system and update how to use section in this file. But who knows, maybe I can come back and work on this project again.

## Description
This is a simple game engine that I am developing for fun.
It is written in C++ and uses OpenGL for rendering.
The engine is still in development and is not ready for use.
This message is written by AI 🤠🤠.

## Features
-Ok I'm writing this now.
-For now, engine has some kind of object system and some basic logic in these objects.
-I inspired by Unity in object system like MonoBehavior.
-Every object is in a scene and has some functions that are called in their times.
-Also every object has some main features like position, rotation, scale etc.
-For now, I only have .h and .cpp files that I need, I'm unsure about how the future will be.
-Probably there won't be any final version of this project.
-I try to write the cleanest code I can all the time.
-Nothing is done in one day in this world, so just trying something.

## How to use
-After I added cmake, you can build the project by using cmake.
-Create a build folder in project directory.
-Cd to it
-Run "cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles""
-Then run "cmake --build ."
-And you should have your .exe file inside build bin

## Dependencies
-GLFW
-GLAD
-GLM
-I might be changed these libraries a little.
